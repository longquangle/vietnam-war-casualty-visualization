    <h3>Preface</h3>
    <p>
      This website is for displaying the interactive visualization of the original data analysis that I completed in 2021. 
      The original Jupyter Notebook can be found <a href="https://longquangle.github.io/vnwarproject/">here</a>. The dataset used in this visualization is found <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/longquangle/vnwarproject/main/data/virtualwall_scrape.csv">here</a>.
      In order to obtain this dataset, I scrapped with permission from the website <a href="https://www.virtualwall.org">The Virtual Wall</a>. The available data on the National Archives does not have as much data about the death location as the data available on the Virtual Wall.

    <h3>Overview of U.S. Casualties</h3>
    <p>
      The Vietnam War resulted in significant casualties for the United States military. The total number of U.S. military fatalities is recorded as 58,220. This figure includes those killed in action (KIA), died of wounds (DOW), and missing in action presumed dead (MIA).

    <h3>Breakdown of Casualties</h3>
    <p>
      Killed in Action (KIA): The majority of U.S. casualties fell into this category. These soldiers lost their lives directly in combat.<br>
      Died of Wounds (DOW): These soldiers succumbed to injuries sustained in combat.<br>
      Missing in Action (MIA): A significant number of U.S. service members were declared missing in action. While some were later recovered or accounted for, others remain unaccounted for.

    <h3>Observation</h3>
    <p>The choropleth displays patterns that result in effective comparisons between the different provinces.</p>
    <p>The main drawback of a choropleth is its inability to account for the difference in the area for each of the provinces. As a result, larger areas may appear more important, even if the data value is not proportionally larger.</p>
    <h4>Total Death</h4>
    <p>
      The choropleth shows an increasing trend in the total death as the province gets closer to the border with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North_Vietnam">North Vietnam</a> 
      and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnamese_Demilitarized_Zone">DMZ Line</a>. Notably, the death count is higher for regions near the border with Cambodida. Although we 
      cannot make any conslusive statement about the visual pattern that we observe. We can suspect that this increase in U.S. Military death count can be attributed to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_trail">Ho Chi Minh trail</a> leading to Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City).
    </p>
    <h4>Average Age</h4>
    <p>
      Visually, the choropleth of average age of death almost has the exact opposite trend as the total death choropleth. The provinces further away from the border with North Vietnam has a higher average age at death. 
      This might mean that the provinces with higher average age at death have more administrative roles in the war and less combat action.
    </p>
    <h4>Average Service Length</h4>
    <p>
      Similar to the choropleth of average age at loss, the choropleth of average service length tends to be highest in the provinces further away from the border with North Vietnam and Cambodia. The visual similarity between the choropleth of average age and service length 
      suggests that the soldiers that stationed in low-combat area tend to be older in age.
